# Screencast Example

This example demonstrates how to start a browser page screencast and capture frames using Rod.

The example starts navigating through different urls and captures the page content using Rod screencast functionality. A web server at http://localhost:8282 displays the captured frames in real-time using both WebSocket and MJPEG streaming.
