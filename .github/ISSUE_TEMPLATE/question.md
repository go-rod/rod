The community is not charity. We welcome constructive questions, but not without limitation.

Check before you submit:

- Is this issue general enough to benefit others?
- Can I provide code to reproduce the issue?
- Can I reduce the unrelated code to make the example minimal?
- Is the example code standalone?
