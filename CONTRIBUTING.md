You might want to learn the basics of [Go Testing](https://golang.org/pkg/testing), [Sub-tests](https://golang.org/pkg/testing), and [Test Suite](https://github.com/stretchr/testify#suite-package) first.

You can get started by reading the unit tests by their nature hierarchy: `Browser -> Page -> Element`.
So you read order will be something like `browser_test.go -> page_test.go -> element_test.go`.
The test is intentionally being designed to be easily understandable.

Here an example to run a single test case: `go test -v -run Test/TestClick`, `TestClick` is the function name you want to run.

We trade off code lines to reduce function call distance to the source code of Golang itself.
You may see redundant code everywhere to reduce the use of interfaces or dynamic tricks.
So that everything should map to your brain like a tree, not a graph.
So that you can always jump from one definition to another in a uni-directional manner, the reverse search should be rare.
